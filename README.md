# Tips

This is my introductory assignment for the Codepath iOS for Designers class.  It's a one screen app, that calculates your ideal tip based on the cost of your meal.

Time: I spent about 2 hours on this exercise.

Features:

- User can calculate a tip, choosing from 3 tip presets
- I designed an app icon as well
